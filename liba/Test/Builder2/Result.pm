=head1 NAME

Test::Builder2::Result - A factory to generate results.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Builder2::Result;

    my $result = Test::Builder2::Result->new_result(%test_data);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A factory to generate results.  See L<Test::Builder2::Result::Base>
for information about the real result objects.

An object to store the result of a test.  Used to keep test history,
format the results of tests, and build up diagnostics about a test.

B<NOTE>: Results are currently in a high state of flux with regard to
directives, what determines if it "passed" or "failed", their
internal structure and this even being a factory.


=head3 Overloading

Result objects are overloaded to return true or false in boolean
context to indicate if they passed or failed.


=head3 new_result

  my $result = Test::Builder2::Result->new_result(%test_data);

new_result() is a method which returns a $result based on your test data.

$result will be a L<Test::Builder2::Result::Base> object.

# So, what the hell is going on here? you may rightfully ask.
# A result is actually a Result::Base object with roles applied to it
# depending on if it pass or failed and any directives.
# This state of affairs will probably change.  Its overcomplicated
# and inflexible.  There's no way to add new directives.

# This maps each of the types of test into the roles which make it up.

    pass        => [qw(pass)],

    skip_pass   => [qw(pass skip)],
    skip_fail   => [qw(fail skip)],
    todo_skip   => [qw(fail skip todo)],
    unknown     => [qw(unknown)],
