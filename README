Test-Ranger version 0.0.4

DEVELOPER README

"The computer should be doing the hard work. 
        That's what it's paid to do, after all."
                                          -- Larry Wall

WARNING: HIGHLY UNSTABLE UNFINISHED DEMO RELEASE

This is a comprehensive solution to several testing and development issues. 
You can write more, better tests in less time; keep track of tests and their 
performance; automate routine tasks and bookmark seldom-executed ones. You 
will be able to spend more of your time writing more reliable production code.

Test-Ranger consists of a GUI tool based loosely on the concept of an 
orthogonal file manager, with configurable windowpanes and embedded terminals; 
a set of templates and tools for building test scripts; a database interface 
for managing large numbers of test scripts; an advanced history function; and 
several examples and demos. 

The full-time professional Perl developer may find Test-Ranger needless, 
having found other solutions. It is hoped that the part-timer, the student, 
the developer coming to Perl from another language, and the lover of baroque 
tools will appreciate the range of gadgetry. Buy-in is kept to a mininum; you 
can use Test-Ranger for a few tasks or for more, without trashing your settled 
approach to work. The GUI is highly plastic with most configurations exposed; 
and extensive help and documentation is built in. 

FOR DEVELOPERS (wishing to contribute to Test-Ranger)

Test::Ranger is a development tool. I don't expect help but I welcome it. 
In particular, you're invited to ask about features you want to see in TR.
