Test-Ranger version 0.0.3

DEVELOPER README

"The computer should be doing the hard work. 
        That's what it's paid to do, after all."
                                          -- Larry Wall

This is a comprehensive testing module compatible with Test::More and friends 
within TAP::Harness. Helper scripts and templates are included to make 
test-driven development quick, easy, and reliable. Test data structure is 
open; choose from object-oriented methods or procedural/functional calls. 

Tests themselves are formally untestable. All code conceals bugs. Do you want 
to spend your time debugging tests or writing production code? 
The Test::Ranger philosophy is to reduce the amount of code in a test script 
and let test data (given inputs and wanted outputs) dominate. 

Many hand-rolled test scripts examine expected output to see if it matches 
expectations. Test::Ranger traps fatal exceptions cleanly and makes it easy 
to check every execution for both expected and unexpected output. 

FOR DEVELOPERS

Test::Ranger is a development tool. I don't expect help but I welcome it. 
In particular, you're invited to ask about features you want to see in TR.
